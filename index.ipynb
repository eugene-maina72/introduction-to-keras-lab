On XX/XX/XXXX I inquired about the why I was now paying them and not my previous lender. On XX/XX/XXXX I again inquired about the missing second loan. The beginning of XX/XX/XXXX I called Fedloan because the monthly payments were different than what I had been paying. \r\nI told them that I was concerned my balloon payment the last two years was going to be over {$500.00}. They did not care. I asked them if I could set up an automatic withdrawal with another amount and they said they could not do this. At the same time I also realized while on the phone that I was truly not eligible for loan forgiveness. \r\n\r\nHad I know I would not qualify I would have left my loan with the other lender. Nowhere did it say that the loan would be turned over even if I did not qualify. I was under the impression that they would keep track of my loan status and let me know if I became eligible. \r\n\r\nMy loan is now going to take a couple of months longer to get paid."

I have my own personal experience with Navient, its subsidiaries, and its associates. I am repulsed by Navient 's attempt to dodge responsibility under the cover of politics. I am repulsed by Navient 's effort to justify their evil mistreatment of consumers at every stage of the loan process. Furthermore, Navient 's response infuriates me because I have no recourse other than the hope of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's lawsuit.

         "My wife became eligible for XXXX Loan Forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX after XXXX for 11 years in a low income district ( a technicality at the state level kept her school building off the list of low income school but it was added retroactively ). We applied immediately to Nelnet and XXXX, the XXXX servicers for her student loans. A little over a month later we received the first round of rejection letters. We had followed the directions as they were written on the federal form and listed all of the qualifying school buildings she had worked in ( all certified by the same CAO in Section XXXX ). Both providers wanted separate applications for each school building while the instructions required only that all schools be listed. We followed the instructions of the servicers and reapplied. We were then rejected by both servicers because the database listed \" XXXX '' instead of \" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' which is what the CAO wrote when he filled out the form for a second time. We were also told that the school was not listed for all of the years the CAO listed for her employment. He listed all 11 years of service and within those years were 5 consecutive years that were listed. After a phone call to XXXX we were also told that we would need to submit a copy of my wife 's XXXX certificate and a letter from her principal stating she had XXXX ( both of which, according to the application ) were certified by the CAO in Section XXXX already and to only list the years that qualified her for forgiveness. The federal application does not ask for these items but a form added by XXXX on their website does. For our third application to XXXX and Nelnet we only listed the five consecutive years of service that qualified and included a printout from the database, included a letter from her principal and a copy of her XXXX certificate, had the CAO certify she had worked at the \" XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' just as the database described it, and filled out the remaining parts of the form exactly as we had the first two times. We sent identical applications to both XXXX and Nelnet. Yesterday we received another rejection from Nelnet stating we filled out section XXXX incorrectly. We had checked the box stating we had applied for forgiveness previously with another servicer and listed XXXX and their contact information. The instructions said that if you had applied and not yet received forgiveness to the the forgiveness amount blank. Neither XXXX nor Nelnet raised this objection with the first XXXX applications. I believe I was, once again, following the directions as they were written but Nelnet wants another application with the other box checked. Thus they will get a couple more months of fees from the government and we will spend another {$500.00} in loan payments for a loan that should have been forgiven several months ago. XXXX will probably raise the same objection. It seems that a new objection is raised every time we apply costing us hundreds of dollars and added interest. The objections are often as a result of unclear directions on the federal form or the servicer just making up their own policies. Should XXXX again reject the application I will file an additional complaint. Had all of these objections been listed upon the first objection we would not be trying to track down signatures during summer break from people on vacation in order to make our fourth application."

Somewhat tediously, we can turn this dictionary inside out and map it back to our word vectors, giving us roughly the original complaint back. (As you'll see, the text won't be identical as we limited ourselves to top 2000 words.)\n",

    "While a bit tangential to our main topic of interest, we need to reverse our current dictionary `word_index` which maps words from our corpus to integers. In decoding our `one_hot_results`, we will need to create a dictionary of these integers to the original words. Below, take the `word_index` dictionary object and change the orientation so that the values are keys and the keys values. In other words, you are transforming something of the form {A:1, B:2, C:3} to {1:A, 2:B, 3:C}. "
